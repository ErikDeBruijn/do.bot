# DO.bot

## Vision
Imagine having an assistant for real world stuff, actions you perform often. Welcome to Do.bot, an open-source project aimed at creating a valuable and easy-to-use interface for all kinds of tasks humans perform together with other people and AI agents. Our goal is to enhance human productivity and collaboration by leveraging the power of AI.

What if you could just ask an AI to add a todo to your task list, control your lights, pay a bill and it will do it as soon as you authorize the action? You can talk with it just like a person (Large Language Model).

## Why Contribute?
By contributing to Do.bot, you'll be part of a project that's at the forefront of AI and human collaboration. You'll have the opportunity to work on challenging problems, learn new skills, and make a significant impact on a tool that could potentially be used by millions of people around the world.

## Status

I just did the initial commits of the project. You're able to have a big impact if you become a contributor early on.

## How to Contribute

Contributions that fit the vision are more than welcome! This is an open source project (GPLv3) started by [https://www.erikdebruijn.nl](Erik de Bruijn). It primary home is at do.bot where it's hosted for everyone to use. I do own the domain name, but I want this to be a community effort as much as possible. I don't intend to make all the decisions and do all the work. I don't even need to control every detail of where this is going. I do have some guidelines to ensure things you may wish to do become integrated.

We welcome contributions from everyone as long as there's some level of dedication that went into it. Here are a few ways you can contribute:

- *Code*: If you're a developer, we'd love your help in improving Do.bot. Check out the Issues tab to see what we're currently working on.
- *Documentation*: Good documentation is crucial to any project. If you enjoy writing and explaining things, you can help us improve our docs.
- *Testing*: Help us catch bugs and improve the quality of Do.bot by testing the software and reporting issues.
- *Ideas*: Have an idea for a new feature or improvement? We'd love to hear it! Feel free to open an issue to discuss your idea.
